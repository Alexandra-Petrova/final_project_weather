Hello!
This is my final project for the Basic Python course.

This program allows you to get the weather forecast from the website Open-Meteo.com. 
After entering the city, you can see its name and the current time in the program. 
The current weather is also displayed (temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed and direction, etc.). Below is the hourly forecast for the current date. The weather for the next three days is also briefly shown.

The project was made using Python 3.12. The PyQt6 was used for the graphical interface.

Thank you for your interest in my project!
